## Lesson Ten: Display
Display are used to change the default behavior of the elements.
They are grouped into two categories:
- Block
    ```css
    display: block;
    ```
In this case the element will take the whole width of the parent element, generally which equal to page or viewPort.

- Inline
    ```css
    display: inline;
    ```
In this case the element will take the width of the content inside it.

- Inline-block
    ```css
    display: inline-block;
    ```
In this case the element will take the width of the content inside it, but it will allow to add margin and padding to it.
